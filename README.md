# Palette Maker

v.1.0: Watch a demo [over at Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/255660211).

Based on [distant-pictures](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/distant-pictures). A simple app to grab a color palette from your surroundings. Takes a photo via Raspberry Pi-connected and Arduino-controlled webcam, and uses [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) to grab the key colors from the image.
